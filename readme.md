In this repository, a set of exercises for learning JavaScript programming language is provided.
The first series of these exercises are presented with the aim of familiarizing you with basic JavaScript commands and functions.

On the other hand, the expectation is that as long as the user gets used to JavaScript, will gradually become familiar with the HTML tags and their styling.

The list of exercises is in the text file exercises_beginner.txt. The first four exercises are solved.

It is suggested to create an HTML file corresponding to the exercise number. Also, write JavaScript commands in the Scripts.js file. If you decide that it is better to create a separate script file for an exercise, do it.

From the links below, you can learn about HTML tags and JavaScript examples.
