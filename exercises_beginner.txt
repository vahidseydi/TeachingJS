1- HTML base code
2- Display current date!
3- get a number(using an input tag) and show(button onClick) whether it is odd or even.
4- get a number(using prompt) and print(document.write) all its less prime numbers.
	sample:
		input: 15
		output: 2,3,5,7,11,13
5- use a form tag and get a number(using an input tag) and show(button onClick):
	btn1: its revers (1234 -> 4321)
	btn2: its sum of digits (1234 -> 10)
        btn3: its number of digits (1234 -> 4)
        btn4: check if it is in fibonacci sequence (13 -> YES)
        btn5: its factorial if nember is less than 15, otherwise show a proper message(alert) ( 5 -> 120) 

6- use a form tag and get a string(using an input tag) and show(button onClick):
	(join, split, toUpperCase,... )
	btn1: its revers (abcd -> dcba)
	btn2: its number of characters (abcd -> 4)
        btn3: its letters in alphabetical order (d1b2ac -> a1b2cd)
        btn4: converts the first letter of each word of it in upper case (the beautiful grey cat -> The Beautiful Grey Cat)

	- get two amount for salary and retrieve who are in between
